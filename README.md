# Re-learning Haskell

## What is this repo?
I was inspired by a recent after-class lecture given by my Linear Algebra professor to dig back into some good old functional programming! Some of the code here might be pretty... rough? Yeah, that sounds about right. So please critique it, the whole point is to re-learn how to write Haskell! I'm gonna be starting off with some pretty basic recursive implementations, and eventually might branch into some other fun stuff (maybe even work my way through an entire book, that'd be a shocker).

## How to compile & test out the code!
So far, I've basically only tested by changing directory into one of the subfolders (recursive-funcs-basic, sorting, etc), and then just spinning up a GHCI instance pointing at the files containing my functions. Ex: `cd sort & ghci sort.hs`
